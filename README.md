# Example Service Override 

Example Service Override for the OpenGraphTopHeadDynamicInclude using 7.3 DXP

### Notes:
The original class should be blacklisted. 
See System Settings -> Platform -> Module Container

A nice addition may be to create a Configuration Interface to support toggling of IncludeQueryString boolean.
